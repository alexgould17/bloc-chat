# Welcome to bloc chat!
bloc chat is a simple multi-user, multi-room chat app that I created using Firebase, Angular, HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript while completing the Web Developer Track at bloc.io. You can sign in, create rooms, view message history & write your own messages. Styling is my own customization of core bootstrap.

## To Use The App
Since this app is not currently hosted, you'll have to clone the code & run the server yourself if you want to run it:
- Open the command line & use git to clone the repository by typing "git clone https://github.com/alexgould17/bloc-chat.git <your-repo-name>". Remember to replace <your-repo-name> with whatever you want the code repository to be called on your computer.
- Install the project dependencies by running "npm install".
- Start the server by running grunt (just type "grunt").
- Navigate your browser of choice to "localhost:3000".
- Enter your desired name & off you go! To send a message, just press enter after you've typed a message & it will send.
- This is an SPA so the chatroom will automatically update when you send/receive messages. Try it with a friend!
- You can end the grunt task by hitting control-c.
